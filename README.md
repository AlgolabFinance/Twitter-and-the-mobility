"How does the social media like Twitter affect the mobility of people in the US during Covid epidemic?" #Scraping24.4millionTweets #NLP #SentimentalAnalysis #Correlation #GrangerCausality

This study aims to quantify the effect of states lockdown policies on daily mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic in USA. We use Covid-19-TweetIDs from Github accumulated from January to April to calculate the sentiment of media’s publications to the epidemic in each US state where lockdown was declared. We regress this data against the Google mobility data to examine and come up with trends that appeared as an after-effect of the Covid pandemic.

Nowadays, it is no longer surprising to wear masks, stick to social distancing norms and reduce mobility. These are the federal policy responses to the global pandemic of Covid-19 that has had a profound effect on the USA as well. Each country had its own way of dealing with the urgent epidemic crisis. 
Concerning the USA, their actions at a governmental level included the initial refusal to close the country and shut down the economy.  The first confirmed case in the country appeared at the end of January 2020 whereas the first confirmed deaths followed in January. Since the situation continued to aggravate, the government started to prepare its healthcare system, implementing certain travel bans and testing for the virus. 
Around the 25th of February, the American public were warned that they needed to prepare for a local outbreak of Covid-19. These news were followed by the national emergency declared by the President Trump on March 13th. On the 16th of March, the gatherings of more than 10 people were restricted and the measures of ‘social distancing’ were advised by the White House. On the 19th of March, US citizens were strongly encouraged by the State Government to avoid international travel. This included placing the ban to enter the country for foreign nationals who had travelled to Iran and 28 EU countries.
The State Government’s approach was to delegate to each US state the decision-making power to battle the Covid-19 outbreak. This means that by March 21st, governors in New York, California and other large states had ordered most businesses to close and for people to stay inside, with limited exceptions. President Trump avoided enacting a tri-state lockdown of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Beginning from April, various state and local officials, including the mayors of New York and Los Angeles, and the governors or health departments of Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island encouraged residents to wear non-medical cloth face coverings while in public, as an additional measure to prevent unknowingly infecting others. 
However, there were 8 US states that avoided complete stay-at-home measures including Utah (partial stay-at-home orders, just for 3 counties), Wyoming (1 county implemented stay-at-home order), Nebraska, Oklahoma ( 9 counties issued lockdown orders), South Dakota, Iowa, North Dakota and Arkansas. The state policies that were targeting the outbursts of Covid-19 included closure of schools, parks, shops, businesses, restriction on gatherings of more than 3 people, orders to stay home with exceptions for grocery shopping once a day.
On one hand, these government actions reduced U.S. economic and social activity.
On the other hand, epidemic research shows that human mobility is one of the main causes of the spread of infectious diseases.
In our study, we will examine the effects of state lockdowns and local policy measures (emergency declarations, school closures, restaurant bans, non-essential business closures and stay-at-home obligations) on mobility of people through the means of twitter publications of leading US media.
